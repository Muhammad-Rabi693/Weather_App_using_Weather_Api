This app is my Full stack Course Final Exam.
In that I create A simple Weather app using Weather Api in React Native with expo cli and Nativewind.
To run this you just have to pull code update its dependencies.
Then run it using "npm expo start" command.
Then it generates QR code and localhost link so you can scan that QR code using "expo go" mobile app.
That's it.
